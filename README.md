### Hello, person 😊

I'm Pedro, cofounder [@zrp](https://github.com/zrp). Nowadays I work with sales 🤷‍♂️, but I code on my spare time 💻. I also write to our [techblog](https://techblog.zrp.com.br/) and have been a guest in [zrpodcast](https://zrpodcast.zrp.com.br/).

You can find me at:

I'm currently focused on:

* 🤖 Applications of ML algorithms to business
* 🍀 Organizational topology and how to develop great teams
* 🗃️ Data analytics applied to sales and customer satisfaction
* ☁️ Infrastructure automation with IaC using non DSL approaches (like CDKTF, Pulumi, etc...) 
* 📦 Different deployment approaches and techniques

This should change pretty often, I hope so 👀

A fun fact is that:

* I was born a Lua 🌕 developer in school, working with Tibia servers.
* I've migrated to Python 🐍 and C 👈 in college.
* I've worked with C# 🪟 in my first job.
* I've being working with Ruby 💎 when I started [@zrp](https://github.com/zrp).
* Nowadays I've become my worst fear, a JS/TS developer 🙈😆
